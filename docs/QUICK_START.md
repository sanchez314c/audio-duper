## 🎵 Your First Scan

### Step 1: Launch AudioDUPER

Open the application from your Applications folder, Start Menu, or terminal.

### Step 2: Select Directory

1. **Click** the "Select Directory" button, OR
2. **Drag and drop** a folder onto the application window

**Good starting points**:

- Your Music folder (`~/Music` on macOS, `C:\Users\YourName\Music` on Windows)
- Downloads folder where you save music files
- External drives with music collections

### Step 3: Configure Scan Options

Choose your scan preferences:

- **Recursive**: Include subdirectories (recommended for most users)
- **File Filters**: Limit to specific formats if desired
- **Minimum Size**: Skip very small files (default: 1MB)

### Step 4: Start Scanning

Click the "Start Scan" button and wait for processing to complete.

**What happens during scanning**:

- AudioDUPER analyzes each file's acoustic content
- Generates unique fingerprints for comparison
- Groups files with matching fingerprints
- Shows real-time progress

### Step 5: Review Results

Once scanning completes, you'll see:

- **Duplicate Groups**: Each group contains identical audio files
- **Quality Indicators**: Visual cues showing which files are higher quality
- **File Details**: Format, bitrate, size, and path information

## 🎯 Managing Duplicates

### Understanding Quality Indicators

AudioDUPER uses a smart algorithm to rank file quality:

**🟢 High Quality** (Recommended to keep)

- Lossless formats (FLAC, WAV)
- High bitrate (320kbps+ for MP3)
- Larger file sizes

**🟡 Medium Quality** (Acceptable)

- Standard bitrate (192-256kbps for MP3)
- Compressed lossless formats
- Medium file sizes

**🔴 Low Quality** (Consider removing)

- Low bitrate (<128kbps for MP3)
- Highly compressed formats
- Small file sizes

### Making Decisions

#### Option 1: Automatic Selection

1. **Click** "Auto-Select Best" in each duplicate group
2. **Review** the selections to ensure they're correct
3. **Click** "Remove Selected" to delete lower quality files

#### Option 2: Manual Selection

1. **Click** on files to preview them (play button appears)
2. **Listen** to compare audio quality
3. **Select** the files you want to remove
4. **Click** "Remove Selected" to delete them

#### Option 3: Keep All

If you're unsure or want to decide later:

1. **Click** "Keep All" to skip this group
2. **Return** later to review again

### Safety Features

**🗑️ Trash/Recycle Bin**: Deleted files go to system trash, not permanent deletion\*\*

- **macOS**: Files go to Trash
- **Windows**: Files go to Recycle Bin
- **Linux**: Files go to Trash (if supported)

**↩️ Undo**: If you make a mistake:

1. **Open** your system Trash/Recycle Bin
2. **Restore** any accidentally deleted files
3. **Rescan** if needed

## ⚙️ Basic Settings

Click the gear icon ⚙️ in the top-right corner or use menu:

- **macOS**: AudioDUPER → Preferences
- **Windows**: File → Settings
- **Linux**: Edit → Preferences

### Key Settings to Configure

#### Quality Preferences

- **Format Priority**: Choose which formats you prefer
- **Bitrate Weighting**: How important is bitrate in decisions
- **File Size Consideration**: Include file size in quality ranking

#### Scan Behavior

- **Default Recursive**: Always include subdirectories
- **File Filters**: Automatically exclude certain file types
- **Performance**: Adjust processing speed vs. resource usage

#### Safety Options

- **Confirm Deletions**: Show confirmation dialog before deleting
- **Backup Before Delete**: Create backup of files to be deleted
- **Log Actions**: Keep record of all file operations

### Statistics Summary

At the bottom of results, you'll see:

- **Total Files Scanned**: How many files were processed
- **Duplicate Groups Found**: Number of duplicate sets
- **Potential Space Savings**: How much space you could reclaim
- **Processing Time**: How long the scan took

## 🚀 Pro Tips

### For Better Results

1. **Organize First**: Clean up messy folder structures before scanning
2. **Large Batches**: Scan entire music library at once for best results
3. **Regular Scans**: Run scans periodically to catch new duplicates
4. **Preview Always**: Listen to files before deleting, especially for similar but not identical files

### Performance Tips

1. **SSD Storage**: Scans are much faster on solid-state drives
2. **Close Other Apps**: Free up CPU and memory for faster processing
3. **Exclude System Folders**: Don't scan system directories
4. **Reasonable Batch Sizes**: Scan 5,000-10,000 files at a time for very large libraries

### Organization Tips

1. **Consistent Naming**: Use consistent file naming conventions
2. **Folder Structure**: Organize by Artist/Album/Track
3. **Quality Standards**: Decide on quality standards for your library
4. **Regular Cleanup**: Scan and clean duplicates regularly

## 🔧 Common Issues

### "App won't open" (macOS)

1. **Right-click** AudioDUPER in Applications
2. **Select** "Open" from the context menu
3. **Click** "Open" in the security dialog
4. **This only needs to be done once**

### "Scan is very slow"

1. **Check storage type**: HDD is much slower than SSD
2. **Close other applications**: Free up system resources
3. **Scan smaller batches**: Process fewer files at once
4. **Exclude unnecessary files**: Filter out non-audio files

### "No duplicates found"

1. **Check directory**: Make sure you're scanning the right folder
2. **Look for similar files**: Some duplicates may have slight differences
3. **Try different formats**: Check if you have same songs in different formats
4. **Large library**: You might not have duplicates (that's good!)

### "Accidentally deleted wrong file"

1. **Don't panic**: Files are in trash/recycle bin
2. **Open system trash**: Restore the file immediately
3. **Check backup**: If you enabled backup options
4. **Rescan**: Run another scan to verify

## 📈 Next Steps

### After Your First Scan

1. **Review Other Folders**: Scan different music directories
2. **Configure Settings**: Customize quality preferences
3. **Set Up Regular Scans**: Make it part of your routine
4. **Explore Advanced Features**: Try export, filtering, and other options
